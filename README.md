Program was written in C++ using the WinAPI libraries. It uses Windows libraries such as Windows.h, so the best option to run this program is to download the source code and compile it on a Windows machine. At the moment, I haven't considered deploying it on Linux. Overall, I wrote this program during the fundamentals of algorithmics course for my first-year studies
